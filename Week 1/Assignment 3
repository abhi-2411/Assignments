Why I Chose VS Code as My Python IDE

I chose Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) because of its versatility, robust features, and extensive 
support for Python development. VS Code is known for its lightweight nature while still offering powerful functionalities that cater to a wide range 
of programming needs, especially in data science and machine learning.


Key Features and Benefits:

1. Extensibility: VS Code supports a wide array of extensions, particularly the Python extension by Microsoft, which enhances the development experience 
with features like IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and Jupyter notebook integration.
2. Integrated Terminal: The built-in terminal allows seamless execution of Python scripts and installation of packages without leaving the editor.
3. Code Editing Features: VS Code provides excellent code completion, syntax highlighting, and error checking, which improve coding efficiency and accuracy.
4. Version Control Integration: Built-in Git support makes version control straightforward, which is crucial for collaborative projects in data science and
   machine learning.
5. Jupyter Notebooks: The ability to open and edit Jupyter notebooks directly within VS Code combines the best of interactive and script-based development.


Simple Python Program in VS Code

Hereâ€™s a simple Python program that prints "Hello, Python!" to demonstrate how easy it is to get started with VS Code:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

To run this program, open VS Code, create a new file with a `.py` extension, paste the code, and run it using the integrated terminal or the run button 
provided by the Python extension.
