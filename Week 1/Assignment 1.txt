Assignment 1:

1) What is Machine Learning, and why is it essential in today's world? Discuss at least three real-world applications of 
Machine Learningand AI.
2) Introduce Python as a programming language. Explain why Python is a popular choice for Data Analysis, Machine Learning 
and Artificial Intelligence.
3) Provide reasons for "Why Python?" in the context of AI. Mention Python's strengths and its relevance to the field.



Machine Learning (ML) involves algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. It's 
crucial today for automation, efficiency, and extracting insights.
Real-world applications include diagnosing diseases from medical images, detecting fraud in finance, and personalizing marketing recommendations based on user behavior.


Python is a popular programming language in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence due to its simplicity,
readability, and powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
It's chosen for its ease of use and robust capabilities in handling complex tasks.


Why Python for AI? Python excels in AI due to its readability, extensive libraries tailored for ML (like scikit-learn) and AI (like TensorFlow), strong community support, and ease of integration
with other technologies. These factors make Python ideal for both prototyping and deploying sophisticated AI applications efficiently.
